This application is a console-based game where a user plays against the computer by selecting from five options: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock. The application determines the winner based on a predefined set of rules. It uses file I/O to store and update a persistent scorecard tracking wins, losses, and ties. 

The application demonstrates modular design with functions, conditional logic, loops, and data structure handling.
